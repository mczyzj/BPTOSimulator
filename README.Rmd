The BPTOSimulator is a `Shiny` package build with `golem` framework. It's purpose it to allow easy setup of BPTO Conjoint Simulator based on Hierarchical Bayes Models. The simulator part of dashboard is build automatically from the data provided. Quick adjustments to Interface Layout might be provided with `custom.css` file.

## Installation

* You can install the boilerplate directly form [GitHub](https://github.com/mczyzj/BPTOSimulator) and play with the example.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mczyzj/BPTOSimulator")
```

* The Simulator works as a package. It means that to make it fully operational you need to download (clone) the repository, and tailor it to your needs.

## Adjustments

There are few things you will need or like to adjust:

* The data set shouls be saved as package data. You will also need to put correct names of your data sets in `app_ui` and `app_server`

```{r eval = FALSE}
### ADJUST THIS LINES WITH YOUR DATA SET NAMES
### app_server.R
respid_filter <- BPTOSimulator::cj_key_filters_example1 %>%
  stats::setNames(snakecase::to_snake_case(colnames(.)))
filter_names <- unique(BPTOSimulator::cj_filters_example1$filter_name)
specs_df <- BPTOSimulator::cj_specs_example1
utils_df <- BPTOSimulator::cj_utils_example1
### app_ui.R
products_change <- BPTOSimulator::cj_specs_example1 %>%
    filter(.data$Min != .data$Max)

filters_change <- split(
  BPTOSimulator::cj_filters_example1,
  BPTOSimulator::cj_filters_example1$filter_name
)
```

* The overall layout. Most of the elements can be quickly adjusted in `inst/app/www/custom.css` file. Also in the `inst/app/www` folder you will find *logo* and *favicon* you will like to change.
